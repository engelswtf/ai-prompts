# Payments Platform Developer Onboarding Guide

## Welcome

Welcome to the Payments Platform team! We process millions of transactions daily and you're joining a team that values reliability, security, and developer experience.

**Expected completion time**: 2-3 days

## Day 1: Environment Setup

git clone git@github.enterprise.com:payments/platform.git
cd platform

# Install dependencies (we use pnpm workspaces)
pnpm install

# Setup local environment
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start infrastructure (Postgres, Redis)
docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Seed development data
pnpm db:seed

# Verify setup - this runs all checks
pnpm verify:setup
```

### Verification

```bash
# Run tests (should all pass)
pnpm test

# Start all services
pnpm dev

## Day 2: Codebase Orientation

### Repository Structure

```
platform/
├── packages/
│   ├── api-gateway/       # Public API (Express + tRPC)
│   ├── payment-service/   # Core payment processing
│   ├── notification-svc/  # Email/SMS notifications
│   ├── shared/            # Shared types and utilities

├── docs/                  # Architecture documentation
└── scripts/               # Development and CI scripts
```

### Key Files to Read First

1. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System overview and decisions
2. `packages/payment-service/src/domain/` - Core business logic
3. `packages/shared/src/types/` - Shared type definitions
4. `packages/api-gateway/src/routes/` - API endpoints

### Core Concepts

#### Idempotency Keys

Every payment request requires an idempotency key to prevent duplicate charges:

```typescript
// All payment endpoints require this header
// X-Idempotency-Key: uuid-v4

const payment = await paymentService.charge({
  amount: 1000,
  currency: 'USD',
  idempotencyKey: req.headers['x-idempotency-key'],
});
```

#### Event Sourcing for Payments

We use event sourcing for payment state - never mutate, only append:

```typescript
// Payment state is derived from events
const events = await eventStore.getEvents(paymentId);
const payment = events.reduce(paymentReducer, initialState);
```
